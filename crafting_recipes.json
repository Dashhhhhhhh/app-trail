The branch should be straight and free of any cracks or weak spots. Using a sharp knife or multi-tool, carefully remove any small branches or knots from the branch.\n\nNext, determine the desired length of the bow (typically around 5-6 feet) and carefully trim the branch to size. Use the knife to carve notches"
